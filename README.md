# <The-new-library>

## Refactored a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to refactor this application and implement GraphQL API. 

- I built this project to better understand how GraphQL works, how to connect the back end and the front end, and to practice the new technology I learned. 

- This application allows a user to search for their favorite books by implementing Google Books API and save selected books.

- I learned GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, use querries and mutations, resolvers and typeDefs, and how to connect client side with the server side.

## Usage 

- From the command line:
- Run npm i
- Run npm run seed
- Run npm run start
- A browser will open at http://localhost:3000/
